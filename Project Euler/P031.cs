         * Problem 31: Coin sums
         * In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
         * 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
         * It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
         * 1 * £1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p
         * How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
